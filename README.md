# bookingApplicationAWS

To gain access to our application, the EC2 instances that we created earlier have to be running. Once this is done, the application is then fairly easy to use. Simply navigate to the Public DNS of the adminserver EC2 instance:
http://ec2-18-214-23-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

Here, a user is presented with input fields/questions to fill out and then submit their answers in order to make a booking. After that, they can then navigate via the link to the ‘Current Bookings’ page, where they can view their booking. This page also allows any further bookings that have been made to also be viewed in a general table. The clientserver instance can also be found here:
http://ec2-3-92-152-137.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

The two EC2 instances can easily be navigated between each other via the links provided on both web pages.
